My name is Scott Crooks, and I am a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at [Miro](https://miro.com). I currently live in
Utrecht, Netherlands with my wife. As of writing, I have 11 years of experience as a Systems / DevOps / SRE Engineer,
ranging from bare-metal systems all the way to modern cloud systems. I've had the opportunity to work on projects
ranging from small-scale startups to large enterprise environments, and I've gained valuable insights and expertise
along the way.

One of the things that sets me apart is my international experience. I've had the privilege of working with diverse
teams and cultures, and I've learned how to navigate different work styles, communication styles, and business
practices. This has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and has allowed me to develop a global mindset that
I bring to every project.

I have lived in the following countries (in order):

- United States of America (home country) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
- China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
- Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼
- Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
- The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

The one thing I always remember when working with teams or individuals is: **Remember where that person / company /
organization came from.** If you can understand someone's history, then you're already on your way to helping them solve
their problems.

The name of this blog is **DevOpted**, which is a word I chose as a way of expressing how the technology landscape in
the past few years has changed me, and has also changed the way that software is developed for all of us.
